### Aim of the project

The aim of the project was to create a mobile based social fitness app that would use google's landmark recognition to locate start and end points of a run from a user's photo.

### Planning

To plan the project, we initially drew out what pages would be needed and the routes users would take to get to them.

We then used Balsamiq to create mock ups of each page that would give a a reference to how the app should look as well and the user journey.

### Coding

The app was built using a MEAN stack and integrated Google Maps and Google Vision api's.

Languages used:
* Node
* Express
* Angular
* Mongo
* SCSS
* HTML5

### What went well

##### Planning

After realising our first idea didn't cover all the CRUD bases, we came up with this idea relatively quickly.

Creating a balsamiq mock up went well and we were quickly able to visualise how the app was intended to work and look.

##### Coding

We worked well together working out what needed to be done and who would be best suited for the job.

### What was a challenge

##### Planning

We stumbled across a few planning problems during the coding process.

We had intended on creating a few more extra features but as the app unfolded and we realised we would hit the MVP later than expected, we didn't have a concrete idea of what exact routes we needed.

#### Coding

Due to varying skill levels in the group, it was difficult for everyone to contribute to certain parts of the project.

### If we had more time we'd like to...

* Create user profiles
* Geolocation API if Google Vision doesn't pick up location
* Allow users to add routes
* Have a news feed of the latest activity
* Have a leaderboard
* Be able to rate routes
* Have routes for different cities / countries
